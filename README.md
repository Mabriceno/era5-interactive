# ERA5 Interactive Climate Explorer

## 🌍 Context and Purpose

This project is a web-based tool to explore reanalysis climate data from the ERA5 dataset. It offers an interactive and intuitive interface for scientists, analysts, and technical users to:

- Visualize spatial climate fields.
- Explore temporal patterns with custom aggregation.
- Select regions or points and generate climate indices.
- Compare time series of those indices interactively.
- Export the generated data for further analysis.

The platform is also designed as a demonstration of technical and scientific programming skills for job applications in climate data analysis and visualization roles.

## 📊 Core Features

### 1. Variable Selection
- Drop-down menu of available ERA5 variables (`t2m`, `tp`, `msl`, etc.).
- Loads and displays the most recent available map for the selected variable.

### 2. Spatial Visualization
- Interactive heatmap using Plotly.
- Hover for value inspection.
- Fixed projection and view (e.g., South America or custom domain).
- Option to view single date or aggregate over time range (`mean`, `sum`, etc).

### 3. Spatial Selection
- Click on the map to select a point.
- Use sliders or bounding box to select a region.
- Predefined region list (optional).
- Generates a new index per selection.

### 4. Time Series Viewer
- Interactive Plotly line chart.
- Add multiple indices to same plot.
- Zoom, pan, and hover enabled.
- Colored legend and removable series.

### 5. Export
- Button to export generated indices as `.csv`.
- Format: `date, index1, index2, ...`

## 🔍 Additional Notes
- The project is designed to be **modular and well documented**.
- A small subset of ERA5 will be used for testing (1-2 variables, 5 years, 1° grid).
- Focus on user experience, fast loading, and visual clarity.
- `README.md` will include purpose, setup instructions, and screenshots.
